		<!--Additional features members get are need to be greyed out for non-members. Can we do this with JavaScript
		or via boolean var in DB? Like, we could have a class for a general user, and if they hit "loggin" it sets a
		bool var to true and creates an obj of the loggedUser class? thus giving access to the user all the greyed out
		features? Otherwise...I think we might have to create a whole bunch of duplicate pages..1 or members and other
		for non-members-->
