					<p style="margin-top:0px;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are excited to have you here! We would like to offer you a page where 
					you can find any recipe that's been uploaded to our database. Here on Kooky Cooks we strive to deliver 
					a fast, easy way to gather ideas to help plan your next meal. Whether that's a small meal for one, or 
					a huge party of 50,000 guest. Take a look around our site and start to find ideas to spark your next 
					food addiction.
					<br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ever walk into the kitchen and stare at the food like, "What am I supposed to make with any of this?"
					We'd like to offer you a website where you can plan your own meals. When you sign up as a member, you get some added features. On the left is a
					list of features which are available on this website. The features you have access to without signing
					up are links in which you can use to access them. Those features not made into links are features you
					could have access to by signing up.
					<br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Click the <a href="../Profile/Profile.html">Profile</a> link to the left to go to
					your profile page. On your profile page you can edit your personal information or add a recipe to your grocery list.
					You can also just click <a href="../addRecipeForm/addRecipeForm.html">Add Recipe</a> to the left to go directly to
					the Recipe Form. The <a href="../Search/Search.html">Search Recipes</a> link to the left will take you to
					a search page that will allow you to search for different recipes. We will also pair those dishes with recommended dishes, 
					in addition to some side dishes you may enter that you would like to pair with the main dish. You can search from a broad 
					category (like breakfast or Mexican), a specific main dish (tacos), or specific keywords (gluten free, spicey, pasta). 
					You can <a href="../../index.html">loggout</a> directly from the main site or from within your profile page.</p>
